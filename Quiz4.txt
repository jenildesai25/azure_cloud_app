Quiz Q4, Spring 2019   (c) DL, UTA, 2019


  C&P means cut and paste only those relevant lines from your program(s) into this quiz.


 1.  I understand that I am on my honor during this quiz, I will not collaborate, use 
     non-allowed sources, and I will not discuss or share this quiz with anyone for the next 
     4 hours.
     You MAY: use Google to search, use previous source code, 
     YOU MAY NOT use:
     Email, Facebook, Hangouts, IM, chats, Skype or ANY other human connection.

     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     When you are complete, with any part, please raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

     If you have computer, or other, problems, please raise your hand immediately.

     If you understand and agree, please initial here:

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name and 
    student ID in large font at the top of every web page dispayed (for this quiz)
    The cloud service provider is Microsoft Azure.

Show and submit code:

 6. Import the datasets into a Relational Data Base (SQL), if you have already done this, (briefly) explain/describe
    how you did this. Please note that for some parts of the following you will need to create indexes (keys)
    appropriately.

 7. (Using the population data) Allow a user, through a web form, to give a year (for example 2017) and three ranges 
    (in millions, for example 20 to 50, 10 to 20, and 0 to 10, representing 20 million to 50 million in the first group, etc.)
    and show (web page) how many states there are in each group (no "visualizing", no graphing necessary).

 8. Using what was done in the previous question, showing the same web form, please show a page,
    followed by a either a pie chart or a vertical bar chart on that page, which is at least half the width of the screen, 
    which shows the number of states in each range. Each bar or pie slice should be in a different color, 
    please show labels inside or to the right of each bar, or inside or adjacent to each pie slice.

 9. Using the education data set, please create a web form that allows a user to give a three letter code and a range of years,
    (for example "CRI", 1980 to 2010) and show a point chart (scatter chart) where the x axis is year, and the y axis is BLPercent,
    please label the x and y axis. (If you are having problems you may "normalize" the years by subtracting the minimum dividing
    by 5, then add one, so 1970 becomes (1970-1970)/5+1 = 1, 1975 becomes (1975-1970)/5+1 = 2, etc. This is NOT required, you may 
    also just use 1970, 1975, etc. You may need also to normalize the y axis).

10. Using the population data set, allow a user, through a web form, to give a year (for example 2017) and a range
    value (in millions, for example 3), and find the number of states in each population segment: 0 to 3 million, 
    3 million to 6 million, 6 million to 9 million (there are 10 states), etc. Then show a either a pie chart or 
    a horizontal bar chart on that page, which is at least half the width of the screen, which shows the number of states 
    in each range. Each bar or pie slice should be in a different color, please show labels inside or to the right of each bar, 
    or inside or adjacent to each pie slice.

Bonus:
    Modify the previous question to allow 3 different years (or a range of years) to be given and show a bar chart year by year
    for each segment, in different colors. That is for the range of 1, and years 2012 (through 2014) show a bar chart where
    the first bar for year 2012, population 0 to 1 million, followed by year 2013, population 0 to 1 million, then by year
    2014; then for year 2012, population 1 to 2 million, followed by year 2013, population 1 to 2 million, etc.

 11. Show GTA parts (6 not necessary), 7, 8, 9, 10, Bonus
     (as soon as you complete any part.)

 13. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.

 Good Luck!
